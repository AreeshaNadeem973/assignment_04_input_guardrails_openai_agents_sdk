🛡️ Assignment – Input Guardrails (OpenAI Agents SDK)

This project demonstrates the implementation of Input Guardrails using the OpenAI Agents SDK in Python.
It includes three exercises showcasing how agents can be controlled and restricted using predefined guardrail rules.

Exercises:
Input Guardrail Trigger – Detects restricted inputs and triggers InputGuardRailTripwireTriggered.
Father Agent & Guardrail – Prevents actions when the temperature is below 26°C.
Gate Keeper Agent & Guardrail – Blocks students from other schools.

🧠 Goal: Learn how to use guardrails to manage safe and context-aware agent behavior.
🛠️ Tech Stack: Python 3.10+ | OpenAI Agents SDK | Asyncio | Logging
